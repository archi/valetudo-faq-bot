title: Valetudo FAQ bot
short-title: about

text:
The @valetubot is the single, most advanced bot for answering questions regarding Valetudo.
It's enormous corpus contains over $:data_corrupted:$ answers! Thanks to the state-of-the art datacenter in a nearly moisturefree German basement and high-speed DSL, its uptime is asymptotically approaching 24 hours. It is currently not known what happens then.

In the unlikely event you find the existing answers lacking, check out https://github.com/archi/valetudo-faq-bot or talk directly to @ArchimedesMP, who did definitely not hack this together in a single evening.

Currently, the most useful command is /faq - just append one or more keyword to search for, like "/faq vaers".

If you're shy, just open a private chat with the bot at @valetubot (the bot is shy as well).
