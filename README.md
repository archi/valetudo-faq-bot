# valeduto-faq-bot
Simple FAQ bot for the valetudo telegram channel

For use with my [Simple Telegram FAQ bot](https://github.com/archi/simple-tg-faq-bot)

# Adding entries

Check the file format in the `valetudobot/faq` folder; it's really simple. The most technical thing is forking this git and creating the PR.

And that's about it: Just create a PR with `valetudobot/faq/your_great_new_entry.txt`.

If something is off, I'll help you fixing it it (or I'll fix the file parser) :)
